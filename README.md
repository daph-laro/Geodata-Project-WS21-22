# Geodata WS 21/22 Group D

## Description & Motivation
This repository utilizes various software to extract, format, display and analyze geo-spatial data derived from `opendata.dwd.de`. As students of Environment & Energy BSc it is a great gift to be able learn to understand how the world works around us. This project is interesting because the student moves from understanding how observations are made to engineering observational solutions in geo-termporal frameworks and other illustrative/predictive software. This learnable ability is amazing. 

As a team we attempt to fulfill all the tasks predetermined in the file located here `https://github.com/rolfbecker/EE_3.07_Geodata_WS2021/tree/main/gdms0000_Final_Assignment`.
 
## Project Organization
The Task Folders above contain all necessary data imports and exports to which each author specialized. An annotated workflow (walkthrough) is also provided. Shared outputs eg. `Task 4` and `Presentation & Video Presentation` are combined efforts.

### Important Reference Repository and Other Data
Professor Rolf Becker - `https://github.com/rolfbecker/EE_3.07_Geodata_WS2021.git`.

The open source dataset of dwd.de is a primary source of data for teh project (found here https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/annual/climate_indices/kl/historical/). 

Furthermore, within each Task folder references for other used data are recorded and linked.
